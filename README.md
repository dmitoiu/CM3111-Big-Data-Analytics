The CM3111 Big Data Analytics Project is a series of Experiments written in the R Programming Language and Python.
It supports the LaTeX Software System.

## Problem Definition

**This project is designed to help reproduce the analysis of a dataset related to the quality of a product 
provided by a wine business, the product that will be analysed is the red variant of the Portuguese "Vinho Verde" 
wine provided by the business, the analysis of this dataset will allow the separation of the good products and 
the bad products provided by the wine business by making use of common machine learning algorithms such as the
Logistic Regression Model and the Random Forest Model.**

## Story

**The objective of analysing the red variant of the Portuguese "Vinho Verde" wine provided by the wine business 
is to separate the products that have the required chemical composition to be classified as good quality products 
of those products that do not have the required chemical composition which will be classified as bad quality 
products.**
